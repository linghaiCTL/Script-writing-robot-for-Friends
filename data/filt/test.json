Ross points out that Rachel had previously declared she was done with men, but Rachel explains that she now realizes it's not about avoiding relationships altogether, but about finding the right person. She expresses her desire for someone who can be both her best friend and someone who can make her feel passionate. Ross agrees that it's possible to find someone who can fulfill both roles.\n\nMeanwhile, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler return from watching a movie. Joey complains that the movie was a \"suck-fest\" and a \"chick-flick,\" while Monica and Phoebe defend it. Joey jokes that he doesn't need violence in a movie, just some nudity, specifically female nudity.\n\nRoss announces that he has to leave to give Marcel a bath and mentions that Marcel will be spending the next day with Rachel. Monica playfully objects, but Ross dismisses her, saying she won't even be there. The scene ends with Ross leaving with Marcel, and Rachel saying goodbye to Marcel.",

Phoebe suggests a quirky experiment involving a turkey to demonstrate her point, which Chandler humorously supports by offering to butter Ross's head.\n\nMeanwhile, Monica is insistent that Rachel open an envelope she has received, which turns out to be a collection of money from the group to help Rachel with her financial troubles. Rachel is deeply grateful for their support.\n\nThe scene shifts to Chandler receiving his traditional Thanksgiving meal, which consists of tomato soup, grilled cheese, and Funyuns. Rachel is surprised by this and questions Chandler about his choice of meal. Chandler then shares a deeply personal story about his childhood, revealing that his parents announced their divorce to him during a Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old. This traumatic memory has left him with a negative association with the holiday, explaining his unconventional meal choice.\n\nThe scene ends with a mix of humor and emotional depth, highlighting the group's support for each other and Chandler's vulnerability.",

Rachel enters from her bedroom, asking everyone to close their eyes for a moment, which Joey refuses to do, having been tricked before. Phoebe is curious about what's happening, and Rachel admits to doing something stupid the previous night. Before Rachel can explain, Paolo enters, greeting everyone with \"Bon giorno tutti!\" (Good morning, everyone!), which elicits a disgusted reaction from Phoebe. The scene ends with this unexpected arrival and Phoebe's reaction.",

Phoebe confesses that she was the one who forgot to tell Joey, explaining that she was distracted by Chandler hiding in the closet.\n\nJoey is frustrated, but Janice dismissively tells him to just get another appointment. Phoebe, feeling guilty, decides to call the casting director directly to fix the situation, despite Joey's protests. She pretends to be from Phoebe Buffay's office and starts negotiating with the casting director, even writing notes on Chandler's neck when she needs a surface to write on.

Her friends propose a toast to her upcoming marriage, but Rachel seems uncertain and contemplates having a \"last fling\" before settling down. Chandler overhears this and awkwardly interjects, pretending to drop and pick up a pool ball.\n\nMonica and Rachel recognize each other from high school, and they exchange pleasantries, with Rachel showing off her engagement ring.

Joey, with his usual bravado, leads the operation, joking about his experience with \"big and long\" things. Ross tries to keep everyone focused, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation, while Phoebe is convinced that Ugly Naked Guy is already dead.\n\nAs they maneuver the poking device toward his window, they carefully adjust the angle, with Joey giving precise instructions. When they finally poke him, they discover that he is indeed alive, much to Phoebe's surprise. However, the poking seems to upset him, and he retaliates by showing them his own \"poking device,\" much to the group's amusement. Joey confidently dismisses Ugly Naked Guy's attempt, saying it won't reach them. The scene ends with the group reacting to the awkward and humorous situation.",

Meanwhile, Phoebe tries to engage Sergei in conversation by mentioning Boutros Boutros Gali, but the interaction is brief. Phoebe then asks Mischa to relay compliments about Sergei's suit, which leads to a quick exchange of compliments between Phoebe and Sergei.\n\nAs the conversation continues, Monica discusses her career as a chef and her aspirations to open her own restaurant. However, Phoebe becomes frustrated because Mischa is more focused on Monica, leaving her and Sergei with little opportunity to talk. Phoebe asks Monica to be less engaging in the conversation so that she and Sergei can have a chance to interact, but Monica feels it's unfair to sit silently while the others talk.",

Rachel is upset because Joshua, her love interest, hasn't called, and she's comparing her situation unfavorably to Ross's happiness in Vermont.\n\nChandler, feeling out of place, decides he wants to leave and calls out the group's behavior, suggesting that they should stop him from getting too drunk and calling his ex-girlfriends, Kathy and Janice.

Chandler feels that Joey values Ross more than him, which hurts his feelings.\n\nJoey, trying to explain himself, reveals that he wasn't actually trying to save Ross\u2014he was trying to save his sandwich, which was next to Ross. Chandler is incredulous, pointing out that Joey risked his life for a sandwich. Joey defends his actions, calling it instinct and insisting that the sandwich is the \"greatest sandwich in the world.\"\n\nTo prove his loyalty to Chandler, Joey offers him a bite of the sandwich. Chandler takes a big bite, much to Joey's surprise, who then quickly takes the sandwich back, realizing Chandler misunderstood the gesture. The scene ends with Joey expressing frustration, while Chandler seems to have lightened up a bit, enjoying the sandwich.",

Monica explains that Rachel's flight was delayed, but she should be back. Ross expresses concern about Rachel being mad at him for leaving her on the plane to Greece to chase after Emily.

The rest of the group, including Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Rachel, are outside the bathroom, trying to navigate the awkward situation.\n\nEmily is furious, feeling humiliated in front of her family and friends, while Ross tries to downplay the situation, claiming Emily is just fixing her makeup. Meanwhile, Joey is more concerned about whether they'll still get cake, and Phoebe hilariously calls Emily's mother pretending to be Ross's doctor, blaming his mistake on a lack of brain medicine.\n\nChandler and Monica have a brief, awkward moment where they discuss their own secret relationship, which they agree to keep only in London. Rachel, feeling conflicted, tries to talk to Monica about what Ross saying her name might mean, but Monica warns her to stay away from Ross, reminding her that he's married.\n\nAs the tension builds, Ross tries to rally the guests to dance, but no one joins him. Joey, meanwhile, is eating steak with his hands, and Monica scolds him for breaking his promise to Phoebe about not eating meat.\n\nRachel confronts Ross, trying to convince herself and him that his saying her name didn't mean anything, but Ross's hesitation suggests otherwise. When Joey informs Ross that the band is ready for their first dance, Ross snaps, showing his frustration.\n\nFinally, Ross opens the bathroom door to find that Emily has escaped through the window, mirroring a similar incident from Rachel's past.

Ross points this out, and Rachel is embarrassed, recalling a similar incident that happened when her grandfather died. After Rachel manages to stop the bleeding, Ross attempts to continue his explanation, but the moment is awkward and Rachel misunderstands his statement, thinking he's referring to their inability to see each other due to their respective relationships.

Rachel jokingly refers to Carol as \"Carol Lesbian,\" which Ross sarcastically approves of.\n\nRoss then brings up a prank Rachel played on him, which left a visible line on his face, causing embarrassment at his workplace. Rachel apologizes, explaining that she didn\u2019t tell him because he was already angry. Ross expresses his frustration with practical jokes, stating that they\u2019re not funny and can be harmful.\n\nCarol enters the scene, unaware of the situation, and defends practical jokes, finding them amusing. Ross points out the line on her face, which prompts her to check it in the bathroom. Rachel argues that pranks are harmless and are even necessary for teaching kids life lessons, especially since Ben doesn\u2019t have any siblings.\n\nRoss, however, insists that Rachel stop teaching Ben such pranks, fearing the impact on his son. Rachel reluctantly agrees but expresses her disappointment at losing her role as \"Fun Aunt Rachel.\" Ross clarifies that he appreciates their bonding but wants to ensure Ben isn\u2019t negatively influenced.\n\nThe scene ends with Ben yelling in frustration from off-camera, prompting Rachel to rush out to help him.",

The woman explains they are on their honeymoon, and the agent offers to upgrade them to first class.\n\nSeeing this, Monica urges Chandler to pretend they are also on their honeymoon to get the same treatment. Chandler reluctantly agrees, and Monica playfully suggests he \"grab her ass\" to sell the act. When they reach the counter, Monica acts overly affectionate, claiming they are on their honeymoon. However, the agent informs them that all first-class seats are taken, and the couple in front got the last ones. Monica laments that if they had gone around the couple earlier, they might have gotten the first-class seats. Chandler, ever the optimist, asks if there's any chance their seats (25J and K) aren't together, hinting at his usual humor.",

When Mona unexpectedly arrives with a Valentine's dinner, the situation becomes awkward as Rachel is still present in the apartment. Mona questions why Rachel is there, and Ross explains that Rachel has been feeling lonely and has been spending a lot of time at the apartment.\n\nMona suggests that Rachel should leave to give them privacy, but Rachel reveals that she actually lives there. The tension is lightened slightly when Ross presents Mona with a Valentine's gift, but the scene ends with an unresolved tension between the three characters, particularly Mona's discomfort with Rachel's presence.",

Chandler playfully responds, and Joey continues to tease him about the idea of being with only one woman for the rest of his life.\n\nSuddenly, a stripper arrives at the door, and Joey and Chandler awkwardly try to figure out what to do. Joey initially pretends to be Chandler, but Chandler corrects him. The stripper asks which one of them is Chandler and then heads to the bedroom, leaving the two friends confused and unsure of how to proceed. Joey hilariously concludes that the stripper is a \"naked hooker,\" adding to the absurdity of the situation.",

Joey asks Chandler for a bobby pin to try and unlock the door, but Chandler initially jokes about not having one since he's not a nine-year-old girl. Joey then makes a playful jab about Chandler's throwing skills.\n\nChandler distracts Joey by bringing up Joey's crush on Rachel, which Joey admits is causing him internal conflict and making him feel guilty, especially since it affects his relationship with Ross. Joey expresses his wish for things to go back to normal and for his feelings for Rachel to disappear.\n\nChandler reassures Joey that he's not doing anything wrong by helping Rachel and the baby, but he also points out the obvious issue of Joey's feelings for Ross's ex-wife. The conversation shifts back to the door, and Chandler suggests trying to open it with a credit card, which they attempt, but Chandler ends up losing the card behind the door.",

Mike, however, steps up to play with Monica.\n\nAs they prepare to play, Chandler warns Mike about Monica's competitive nature, even showing a scar from a past Pictionary game. Mike confidently asserts that he can handle it, and the two start playing. The game quickly escalates into a high-stakes bet, with Monica and Mike raising the stakes from ten dollars to a thousand dollars.\n\nChandler and Phoebe watch in amusement as the game becomes more intense. Monica and Mike flip a coin to decide who serves first, with Monica losing the toss. The game continues, and Mike uses a technicality from table tennis rules to win a point, much to Monica's frustration.

Initially, Joey is generous and offers Sarah some of his fries, which she happily accepts. However, when Sarah shows interest in Joey's stuffed clams, Joey becomes visibly uncomfortable and tries to block her from taking any more food from his plate.\n\nJoey's frustration escalates when Sarah continues to reach for his food, leading him to take her hand and compliment her to distract her. When she persists, Joey finally explodes, expressing his strong dislike for people taking food off his plate. Sarah is confused and upset, pointing out that Joey had previously said \"What's mine is yours.\" Joey then admits he didn't mean it and explains that he has \"certain rules\" when it comes to food, even going so far as to scrape dropped food back onto his plate and eat it.\n\nThe scene highlights Joey's quirky and possessive attitude towards his food, creating an awkward and tense moment on their date.",
